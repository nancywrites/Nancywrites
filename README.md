***

I am passionate about storytelling and making written words easier to understand. 
I enjoy brainstorming, research, and problem-solving as much as I enjoy writing. I am currently changing my life through tech.

I am an avid reader with a deep love for travel, kindness, yoga, meditation, skincare, and self-care. You would find me curled up on a sofa reading a romance, mystery, suspense, or detective thriller novel on a rainy day. I am trying to master chess - Finally found out how the knight piece moves.😄

I currently contribute to open-source projects like [Technical writing resources.](https://github.com/CynthiaPeter/Technical-Writing-Resources)
