***

I am passionate about storytelling and making written words easier to understand. 
I enjoy brainstorming, and research as much as I enjoy writing. I am currently changing my life through tech.

I am an avid reader with a deep love for travel, kindness, skincare, and self-care. You would find me curled up on a sofa reading a romance, mystery, suspense, or detective thriller novel on a rainy day. I am trying to master chess - Finally found out how the knight piece moves.😄

I currently contribute to [Api Learning Library](https://github.com/nancywrites/api-learning-library/), [Technical writing resources](https://github.com/CynthiaPeter/Technical-Writing-Resources) & [Fedora like I am 7](https://nancywrites.hashnode.dev/fedora-like-i-am-7-simplifying-fedora-for-all-ages)
